It is important to enable good data management to support scientific discovery. Some of the challenges of data management include:\n","\n","* Heterogeneity of data (e.g. morphology reconstructions, electrophysiology recordings, whole-brain imaging, simulations, validations)\n","* Varying size of datasets (small to large)\n","* Data is often stored in distributed silos (lab servers, personal computers, dropbox, google drive)\n","* Data provenance is often not easily accessible (metadata kept in different spreadsheets, hand-written labbooks, not captured)\n","\n","&rightarrow; **Discovery of similar and related data across silos is hard!**\n","\n","\n","###  1-2 The FAIR Data Principles\n","\n","The FAIR Guiding Principles. were defined to help the scientific community in implementing good data management. The acronym stands for: **Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability**. They are a set of principles intended to help enhance the reusability of scientific data with specific emphasis on usability of data by both machines and humans. \n","\n","[FAIR Data Principles](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618)\n","\n","###  1-3 What is Nexus?\n","\n","#### Nexus is...\n","\n","* A data repository\n","* A metadata catalog\n","* A semantic search engine\n","\n","At the core of Blue Brain Nexus lies a knowledge graph [(What is a knowledge graph?)](https://hackernoon.com/wtf-is-a-knowledge-graph-a16603a1a25f). The Nexus KnowledgeGraph operates on **4 types** of resources: **Organizations, Domains, Schemas** and **Instances**, nested as described in the diagram below:\n","\n","<a href= target=http://nexus.apps.bbp.epfl.ch/dev/docs/kg/assets/api-reference/resources.png \"_blank\"><img src=http://nexus.apps.bbp.epfl.ch/dev/docs/kg/assets/api-reference/resources.png \n","width=\"500\" border=\"10\" /></a>\n","\n","\n","The Nexus KnowledgeGraph exposes a RESTful interface over HTTP(S). The generally adopted transport format is **JSON-LD**. All resources in the system generally follow the very same lifecycle (see diagram below).

Her model uses experimental data collected by Brian, an experimental neuroscientist using *in vitro* patch-clamp recording techniques for his research, producing both electrophysiology as well as morphology data.

This is where schemas come into place: Schemas define properties an entity has and help further constrain them. In the case of Nexus, schemas are written in the so-called **Shapes Constraint Language** ( [SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/) ) and stored in JSON-LD format. \n","\n","**Use the [JSON editor online](https://jsoneditoronline.org/) to** \n","* inspect the provided schemas for **Subject, Neuron and Dataset**\n","* familiarise yourself with the structure of the schemas and the properties provided \n","* extend the Subject schema with a property \"strain\" (the property should be required with a maximum count of 1) \n","\n","<font color='red'>NOTE</font>: To inspect and extend the schemas, copy the provided schemas from below and paste them into a new editor window in the [JSON editor online](https://jsoneditoronline.org/).
